# Summer - AI YouTube Summarizer

This is a Next.js application built with Firebase Studio that allows users to get AI-powered summaries of videos from their favorite YouTube channels.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure. Here is an overview of the key directories:

-   **/src/app/**: Contains the core application routes and layouts.
    -   `layout.tsx`: The root layout for the entire application.
    -   `page.tsx`: The public-facing login page.
    -   **/dashboard**: A route group for all authenticated pages.
        -   `layout.tsx`: The main layout for the dashboard, including the sidebar and header.
        -   `page.tsx`: The main dashboard page, which displays the video summary cards.
    -   `globals.css`: Global stylesheets and Tailwind CSS theme configuration (ShadCN).

-   **/src/components/**: Contains all the reusable React components.
    -   **/ui**: Houses the UI components from the ShadCN library.
    -   **/dashboard**: Components that are specific to the dashboard, like `summary-card.tsx` and `channel-list.tsx`.
    -   `logo.tsx`: The application's logo component.

-   **/src/lib/**: Contains utility functions and shared data.
    -   `utils.ts`: Utility functions, such as `cn` for merging Tailwind classes.
    -   `data.ts`: Static mock data for displaying channels and summaries.
    -   `firebase.ts`: Firebase initialization and configuration.
    -   `auth.ts`: Contains authentication logic and hooks for managing user sessions.

-   **/src/ai/**: Contains all the Genkit AI-related code.
    -   **/flows**: Genkit flows that orchestrate calls to LLMs.
        -   `summarize-video.ts`: A flow to generate a bullet-point summary from a video transcript.
    -   `genkit.ts`: Genkit initialization and configuration.

-   **/public/**: Static assets that are publicly accessible.

## Application Flow

1.  **Authentication**: The user lands on the login page (`/`) and signs in with their Google account using Firebase Authentication. The authentication logic is handled in `src/lib/auth.ts`.
2.  **Dashboard**: After a successful login, the user is redirected to the dashboard (`/dashboard`).
3.  **Channel Monitoring**: The sidebar on the dashboard displays a list of YouTube channels from `src/lib/data.ts`. The user can toggle a switch to enable or disable monitoring for each channel.
4.  **AI Summaries**: The main content area of the dashboard displays a grid of summary cards. Each card represents a recent video from a monitored channel. The summaries are generated by an AI flow (`src/ai/flows/summarize-video.ts`) and are initially hidden within a dropdown.
5.  **Genkit**: The application uses Genkit to interact with Google's AI models. The `summarizeVideo` flow takes a video title and transcript and returns a concise summary.
